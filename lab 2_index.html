Scientific name: <i>Platycerium sp.</i><br>
Family: Polypodiaceae<br>
Division: Pteridophyta<br>
Class: Polypodiopsida<br>
Order: Polypodiales<br>
<br><br>
Morphological characteristics:<br>
An epiphytic fern with distinctive dimorphic fronds and a short creeping rhizome covered by brown scales.
<br><br>
Sterile fronds: <br>Broad, rounded, and lobed; overlap to form a shield-like basal structure that helps collect debris and moisture, anchoring the plant to its host.
<br><br>
Fertile fronds:<br> Long, deeply lobed, and antler-shaped, hanging outward or downward from the base. The lower surface of these fronds bears sori in irregular patches.
<br><br>
Sori:<br> Round to irregular, lacking indusia, scattered across the underside of fertile lobes.
<br><br>
Rhizome: <br>Short and scaly, producing both types of fronds.
<br><br>
Reproduction: <br>By spores released from sori.
<br><br>
Habitat and distribution:<br>
Commonly found epiphytically on tree trunks or branches in humid tropical forests, often in shaded or partially lit areas. Occasionally cultivated on tree bark or wooden plaques.<br> Widely distributed in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, as well as tropical Africa and Australia.
<br><br>
Diagnostic features:<br>

Two distinct frond types: basal (sterile) and antler-like (fertile).<br>

Epiphytic habit with shield fronds that trap organic debris.<br>

Irregular sori without indusia on the underside of fertile fronds.</td>

<td>- In ecological, their basal fronds can collect  rainwater, falling leaves and other organic matter that can make it decomposes whule providing the plant with nutrition.<br><br>

- They have an unique shape of basal that make them more appeal as ornamental displays in home and garden.

Order: Lycopodiales<br>
<br><br>
Morphological characteristics:<br>
An epiphytic or terrestrial lycophyte with erect or pendulous stems that are densely leafy.
<br><br>
Stems:<br> Cylindrical, firm, and repeatedly branched; may grow erect or hanging, depending on habitat.
<br><br>
Leaves (microphylls):<br> Small, simple, lanceolate, spirally arranged, and with a single unbranched vein; margins entire or slightly toothed.
<br><br>
Reproductive structures: <br>Sporangia borne singly in the axils of fertile leaves (sporophylls) rather than in distinct strobili.
<br><br>
Spores: <br>Produced in sporangia that release dust-like spores for reproduction.
<br><br>
Rhizome: Absent or reduced; the plant anchors to substrates via adventitious roots.
<br><br>
Habitat and distribution:<br>
Found in moist montane forests, often growing epiphytically on tree trunks or occasionally on rocks and forest floors in shaded, humid areas. <br>Common in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, and extending to tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.
<br><br>
Diagnostic features:<br>

Lack of true strobilus (sporangia borne in leaf axils instead).<br>

Erect or pendulous leafy stems densely covered with spirally arranged microphylls.<br>

Usually epiphytic, unlike the creeping terrestrial Lycopodiella.</td>

<td>- In medicine used, they can used for alzheimer's disease as they can increase the acetylcholine levels in the brain which can improve the memory in pateins with dementia.<br><br>

- They are a hanging plants that popular as ornamentals due to their unique appearance.
